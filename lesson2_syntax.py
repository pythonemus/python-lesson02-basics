#Execute Python Syntax
########################

#We can execute python code by either typing directly into 
#python CLI

#Example
# >>> print("Hello, World!")
# Hello, World!

#Or execute python code from a file
#Example
#C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py

  print("six is greater than three!")

    print("six is greater than three!")

#You must have the same number of spaces in the same block of code
#otherwise Python will give you an error:
